## How to contribute to Git-Reflow

Pull requests are welcome. We use this tool every single day and as long as what you want to add doesn't change our workflow, we are happy to accept your updates. General process for contributing changes:
1. [Fork gitreflow](https://github.com/reenhanced/gitreflow/new/master#fork-destination-box).  Learn [more about forks here](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-forks/).
2. Make your changes and push them to your new fork.
3. Please make sure your changes are supported with tests and that they pass.
4. [Submit a Pull Request on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).
5. Our core team will review your code and may request changes. If you would prefer us to make the changes for you, feel free to [permit us to do so](https://help.github.com/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork/) and we'll update on your behalf.
6. Once the code has been approved, we will merge your PR and bundle the changes into our next release of the gem.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change by [opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/reenhanced/gitreflow/issues/new).

* Do not open a PR on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Git-Reflow, or how to customize it for your team by opening a new issue on GitHub.  We will use our conversation to create wikis and documentation to help others as well.

* We use [Yard](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/yard/file/docs/GettingStarted.md) to document our source code. You can see a [full list of where we could use some help here](https://inch-ci.org/github/reenhanced/gitreflow).
