  As a user
  When I install a gem
  It should initialize the gem configuration

    When I build and install the gem
    Then the output should contain "You need to setup your GitHub OAuth token\nPlease run 'git-reflow setup'"
    When I successfully run `git-reflow`
    Then the output should contain "usage: git-reflow [global options] command [command options]"

  Scenario: User sets up GitHub
